During a threat hunt, first, you create a hypothesis, then you investigate it. 

You can uncover new [[TTPs]] and IOCs during a threat hunt. You must pass this information to the Detection Engineering team, so they can create new detection rules from these TTPs. 

If detection engineers discover new alerts and incidents, they will pass this information to the Incident Response team for triage, investigation, and response.

The Threat Hunting team may also discover new incidents during the hunting. 

They also pass this information to the Incident Response team. 
Sometimes, threat hunters find malware in endpoints. 

They will pass these samples to the Malware Analysis team to uncover new TTPs and IOCs.
