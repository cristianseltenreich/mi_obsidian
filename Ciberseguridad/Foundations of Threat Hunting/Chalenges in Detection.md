[[Foundations of Threat Hunting]]

Let me start with the challenges in threat detection to understand why we need threat hunting.

- The first challenge here is about the [[dwell]] time, the length of time an adversary remains undetected inside the network. Advanced adversaries can remain hidden for months before detection. 
- As the second challenge, every day, we see breaches in the news. So, we are [[struggling]] to stop adversaries from getting into our networks and systems.
- The third one is that we cannot fully understand our cybersecurity posture without knowing the current state of compromise.

These challenges emphasize that we need to operate under the "assume breach" mindset.
