The problems in threat hunting:
- The first problem is the skill shortage in the cybersecurity industry. According to the SANS 2020 Threat Hunting Survey, only 19% of threat hunters are working as full-time threat hunters at their organizations. 81% are using staff that also fulfill other roles within the organization, including incident response, forensics, managing SOC alerts, and system administration.
- The second problem is the lack of formal threat hunting processes. Only 37% of organizations have a formal program and methodology with assigned staff for threat hunting.
- The last problem is about measuring the effectiveness of threat hunting. Only 53% of organizations are using ad hoc methods to measure the effectiveness of threat hunting. Most of the organizations are not using an industry-based  framework like MITRE ATT&CK or custom frameworks.  

These problems show that organizations don't have adequate human resources for threat hunting, and they perform ad-hoc threat hunting operations.
