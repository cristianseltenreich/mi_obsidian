Physical attacks are intentional, offensive actions used to destroy, expose, alter, disable, steal or gain unauthorized access to an organization’s infrastructure or hardware.

Examples of physical attacks include:

- Loading malware onto a USB flash drive that infects a device when plugged in.
- Fitting cables and plugs such as generic USB cables, mobile device charging cables and wall or power adapters with advanced technologies, such as a wireless chip, to allow an attacker to control or provide instructions to a device.
- Copying or skimming data from a credit or debit card using a specialized terminal to create a cloned card, which can be used to gain unauthorized access to the victim’s accounts.
