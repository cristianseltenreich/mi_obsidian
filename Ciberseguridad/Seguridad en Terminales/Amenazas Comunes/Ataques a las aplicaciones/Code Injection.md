 Most modern websites use a database, such as a Structured Query Language (SQL) or an Extensible Markup Language (XML) database, to store and manage data. 
 
 Injection attacks seek to exploit weaknesses in these databases.

Some common types of injection attacks:

- [[XML injection attack]]
- [[SQL injection attack]]
- [[DLL injection attack]]
- [[LDAP injection attack]]
