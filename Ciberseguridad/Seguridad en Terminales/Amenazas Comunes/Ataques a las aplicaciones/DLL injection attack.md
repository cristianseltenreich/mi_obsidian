A dynamic link library (DLL) file is a library that contains a set of code and data for carrying out a particular activity in Windows. Applications use this type of file to add functionality that is not built-in, when they need to carry out this activity.

DLL injection allows a cybercriminal to trick an application into calling a malicious DLL file, which executes as part of the target process.
