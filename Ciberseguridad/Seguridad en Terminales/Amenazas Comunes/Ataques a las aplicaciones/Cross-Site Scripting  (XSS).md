Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a common vulnerability found in many web applications. This is how it works:

Cybercriminals exploit the XSS vulnerability by injecting scripts containing malicious code into a web page.

The web page is accessed by the victim, and the malicious scripts unknowingly pass to their browser. 

The malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens or other sensitive information about the user, which is sent back to the cybercriminal.

Armed with this information, the cybercriminal can impersonate the user.
