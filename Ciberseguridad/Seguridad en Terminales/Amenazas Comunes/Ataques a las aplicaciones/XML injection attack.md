An XML injection attack can corrupt the data on the XML database and threaten the security of the website.

It works by interfering with an application’s processing of XML data or query entered by a user. 

Cybercriminals can manipulate this query by programming it to suit their needs. 

This will grant them access to all of the sensitive information stored on the database and allows them to make any number of changes to the website.
