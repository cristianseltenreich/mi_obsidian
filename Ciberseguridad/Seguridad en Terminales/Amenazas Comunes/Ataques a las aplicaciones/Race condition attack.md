Also known as a time of check (TOC) or a time of use (TOU) attack, a race condition attack happens when a computing system that is designed to handle tasks in a specific sequence is forced to perform two or more operations simultaneously.

For example, operating systems are made up of threads — the smallest sequence of program instructions required to carry out a process. When two or more threads access shared data and try to change it at the exact same time, a race condition attack occurs.
