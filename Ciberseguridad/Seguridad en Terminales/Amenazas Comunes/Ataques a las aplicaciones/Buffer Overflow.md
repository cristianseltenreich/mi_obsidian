Buffers are memory areas allocated to an application. A buffer overflow occurs when data is written beyond the limits of a buffer. By changing data beyond the [[boundaries]] of a buffer, the application can access memory allocated to other processes. This can lead to a system crash or data compromise, or provide escalation of privileges.

These memory [[flaws]] can also give attackers complete control over a target’s device.

For example, an attacker can change the instructions of a vulnerable application while the program is loading in memory and, as a result, can install malware and access the internal network from the infected device.

A research carried out by Carnegie Mellon University estimates that nearly half of all exploits of computer programs [[stem]] from some form of buffer overflow
