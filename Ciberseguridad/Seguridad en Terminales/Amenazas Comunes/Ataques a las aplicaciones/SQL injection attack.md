Cybercriminals can [[carry out]] an SQL injection attack on websites or any SQL database by inserting a malicious SQL statement in an entry field.

This attack takes advantage of a vulnerability in which the application does not correctly filter the data entered by a user for characters in an SQL statement. 

As a result, the cybercriminal can gain unauthorized access to information stored on the database, from which they can [[spoof]] an identity, modify existing data, destroy data or even become an administrator of the database server itself.
