Machine learning is a method of automation that allows devices to carry out analysis and perform tasks without specifically being programmed to do so. It powers many of the applications we use today, such as web searching, photo tagging, spam detection, video surveillance, fraud detection and security automation.

Machine learning uses mathematical models to predict outcomes. However, these models are dependent on the data that is inputted. If the data is [[tainted]], it can have a negative impact on the predicted outcome. Attackers can take advantage of this to perpetrate attacks against machine learning algorithms. For example, using tainted data to trick an autonomous vehicle into misinterpreting street signs.
