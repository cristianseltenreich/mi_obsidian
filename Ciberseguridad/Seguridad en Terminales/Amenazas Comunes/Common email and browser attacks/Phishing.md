Phishing is a form of fraudulent activity often used to steal personal information.

Phishing occurs when a user is contacted by email or instant message (or in any other way)  by someone masquerading as a legitimate person or organization. The intent is to trick the recipient into installing malware on their device or into sharing personal information, such as login credentials or financial information.

For example, you receive an email congratulating you for winning a prize. It looks like it was sent from a well-known retail store and asks you to click on a link to claim your prize. This link may in fact redirect you to a fake site that asks you to enter your personal details, or it may even install a virus on your device.
