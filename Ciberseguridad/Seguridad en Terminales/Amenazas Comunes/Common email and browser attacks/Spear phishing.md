A highly targeted attack, spear phishing sends customized emails to a specific person based on information the attacker knows about them (which could be their interests, preferences, activities and work projects).

For example, a cybercriminal discovers through their research that you are looking to buy a specific model of car. The cybercriminal joins a car discussion forum you are a member of, forges a car sale offering and sends you an email that contains a link to see pictures of the car. When you click on the link, you unknowingly install malware on your device.
