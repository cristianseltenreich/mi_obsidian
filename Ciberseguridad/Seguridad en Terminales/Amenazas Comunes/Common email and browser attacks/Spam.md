Spam, also known as [[junk]] mail, is simply unsolicited email. In most cases, it is a method of advertising. However, a lot of spam is sent in [[bulk]] by computers infected by viruses or worms and often contains malicious links, malware or deceptive content that aims to trick recipients into disclosing sensitive information, such as a social security number or bank account information.

Almost all email providers filter spam, but it still consumes bandwidth. And even if you have security features implemented, some spam might still get through to you. Look out for the following indicators of spam:

- The email has no subject line.
- The email asks you to update your account details.
- The email text contains misspelled words or strange punctuation.
- Links within the email are long and/or cryptic.
- The email looks like correspondence from a legitimate business, but there are tiny differences — or it contains information that does not seem relevant to you.
- The email asks you to open an attachment, often urgently.

If you receive an email that contains one or more of these indicators, you should **not** open the email or any attachments. Many organizations have an email policy that requires employees to report receipt of this type of email to their cybersecurity team for further investigation. If in doubt, always report.
