There are many actions that you can take to defend against email and browser attacks. Some of the most important ones are outlined here.

- It is difficult to stop spam, but there are ways to reduce its effects:
    - Most Internet service providers (ISPs) filter spam before it reaches the user’s inbox.
    - Many antivirus and email software programs automatically detect and remove dangerous spam from an email inbox.
    - Organizations should educate employees about the dangers of unsolicited emails and make them aware of the dangers of opening attachments. 
    - Never assume that email attachments are safe, even when they come from a trusted contact. Always scan attachments before opening them.
- Become a member of the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG). It is an international association of companies focused on eliminating identity theft and fraud resulting from phishing and email spoofing.
- All software should be kept up-to-date, with the latest security patches applied to protect against any known security vulnerabilities.
