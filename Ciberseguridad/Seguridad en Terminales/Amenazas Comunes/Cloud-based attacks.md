Rather than developing systems on their own premises, more and more organizations are making the move toward cloud-based computing, as we discussed earlier in this module.

The advantage is that the cloud provider will maintain the equipment but this also opens up an organization to a host of potential threats. Attackers are constantly leveraging ways to exploit sensitive data stored on the cloud, as well as applications, platforms and infrastructure that is cloud-based, as we saw with SaaS, PaaS and IaaS.
