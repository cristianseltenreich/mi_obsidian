Network security relates directly to an organization's business continuity.

Network security breaches can disrupt e-commerce, cause the loss of business data, threaten people’s privacy, and compromise the integrity of information.

These breaches can result in lost revenue for corporations, theft of intellectual property, lawsuits, and can even threaten public safety.

Many tools are available to help network administrators adapt, develop, and implement threat mitigation techniques, including the [Cisco Talos Intelligence Group ](https://talosintelligence.com/reputation_center).

An attack vector is a path by which a threat actor can gain access to a server, host, or network.

Attack vectors originate from inside or outside the corporate network. Data is likely to be an organization’s most valuable asset.

Various DLP controls must be implemented, that combine strategic, operational, and tactical measures. Common data loss vectors include email and social networking, unencrypted data devices, cloud storage devices, removable media, hard copy, and improper access control.

Understanding network security requires you to understand the following terms: threat, vulnerability, attack surface, exploit, and risk. Risk management is the process that balances the operational costs of providing protective measures with the gains achieved by protecting the asset.

Four common ways to manage risk are risk acceptance, risk avoidance, risk reduction, and risk transfer.

Hacker is a term used to describe a threat actor. White hat hackers are ethical hackers using their skills for good, ethical, and legal purposes. Grey hat hackers are individuals who commit crimes and do unethical things, but not for personal gain or to cause damage. Black hat hackers are criminals who violate computer and network security for personal gain, or for malicious reasons, such as attacking networks.

Threat actors include script kiddies, vulnerability brokers, hacktivists, cybercriminals, and state-sponsored hackers. Many network attacks can be prevented by sharing information about IOCs. 

Many governments are promoting cybersecurity. CISA and NCSA are examples of such organizations.

Network security, it is important to know the following terms

- **[[Threat]]**
	A potential danger to an asset such as data or the network itself.
- **Vulnerability**
	A [[weakness]] in a system or its design that could be exploited by a threat.
- **Attack surface**
	An attack surface is the total sum of the vulnerabilities in a given system that are accessible to an attacker. The attack surface describes different points where an attacker could get into a system, and where they could get data out of the system. For example, your operating system and web browser could both need security patches. They are each vulnerable to attacks and are exposed on the network or the internet. Together, they create an attack surface that the threat actor can exploit.
- **Exploit**
	The mechanism that is used to [[leverage]] a vulnerability to compromise an [[asset]]. Exploits may be remote or local. A remote exploit is one that works over the network without any prior access to the target system. The attacker does not need an account in the end system to exploit the vulnerability. In a local exploit, the [[threat]] actor has some type of user or administrative access to the end system. A local exploit does not necessarily mean that the attacker has physical access to the end system.
	Note: A local exploit requires inside network access such as a user with an account on the network. A remote exploit does not require an account on the network to exploit that network’s vulnerability.
- **Risk**
	The [[likelihood]] that a particular threat will exploit a particular vulnerability of an asset and result in an undesirable consequence.

[[Risk management]]


Other commonly used network security terms include:

- **Countermeasure** 
	The actions that are taken to protect assets by mitigating a threat or reducing risk.
- **Impact**
	The potential damage to the organization that is caused by the threat.
