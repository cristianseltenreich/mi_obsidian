Risk management is the process that balances the operational costs of providing protective measures with the gains achieved by protecting the asset. There are four common ways to manage risk, as shown below:

- Risk acceptance
	This is when the cost of risk management options outweighs the cost of the risk itself. The risk is accepted, and no action is taken.
- Risk avoidance [[avoid]]
	This means avoiding any exposure to the risk by eliminating the activity or device that presents the risk. By eliminating an activity to avoid risk, any benefits that are possible from the activity are also lost.
- Risk reduction
	This reduces exposure to risk or reducing the impact of risk by taking action to decrease the risk. It is the most commonly used risk mitigation strategy. This strategy requires careful evaluation of the costs of loss, the mitigation strategy, and the benefits gained from the operation or activity that is at risk.
- Risk transfer
	Some or all of the risk is transferred to a willing third party such as an insurance company.
