Cybercriminals are [[threat actors]] who are motivated to make money using any means necessary. While sometimes cybercriminals work independently, they are more often financed and sponsored by criminal organizations. It is estimated that globally, cybercriminals steal billions of dollars from consumers and businesses every year.

Cybercriminals operate in an underground economy where they buy, sell, and trade exploits and tools.

They also buy and sell the personal information and intellectual property that they steal from victims.

Cybercriminals target small businesses and consumers, as well as large enterprises and industries.
