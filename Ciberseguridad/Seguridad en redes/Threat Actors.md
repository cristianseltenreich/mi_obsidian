Good or bad, hacking is an important aspect of network security. The term[[ threat]] actor is used when referring to those individuals or groups that could be classified as gray or black hat [[hacker]]s.

## History of hacking

Hacking started in the 1960s with phone freaking, or phreaking, which refers to using various audio frequencies to manipulate phone systems. At that time, telephone switches used various tones, or tone dialing, to indicate different functions. Early threat actors realized that by mimicking a tone using a [[whistle]], they could exploit the phone switches to make free long-distance calls.

In the mid-1980s, computer dial-up modems were used to connect computers to networks. Threat actors wrote “war dialing” programs which dialed each telephone number in a given area in search of computers, bulletin board systems, and fax machines. When a phone number was found, password-cracking programs were used to gain access. Since then, general threat actor profiles and motives have changed [[quite a bit]].

## There are many different types of threat actors.

- Script kiddies
	Script kiddies emerged in the 1990s and refers to teenagers or inexperienced threat actors running existing scripts, tools, and exploits, to cause harm, but typically not for profit.
- Vulnerability brokers
	Vulnerability brokers typically refers to grey hat hackers who attempt to discover exploits and report them to vendors, sometimes for prizes or rewards.
- Hacktivists
	Hacktivists is a term that refers to grey hat hackers who rally and protest against different political and social ideas. Hacktivists publicly protest against organizations or governments by posting articles, videos, leaking sensitive information, and performing distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.
- [[Cybercriminals]]
	Cybercriminal is a term for black hat hackers who are either self-employed or working for large cybercrime organizations. Each year, cyber criminals are responsible for stealing billions of dollars from consumers and businesses.
- State-sponsored
	State-Sponsored hackers are threat actors who steal government secrets, gather intelligence, and sabotage networks of foreign governments, terrorist groups, and corporations. Most countries in the world participate to some degree in state-sponsored hacking. Depending on a person’s perspective, these are either white hat or black hat hackers.
