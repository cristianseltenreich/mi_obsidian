Many network attacks can be prevented by sharing information about indicators of compromise (IOC).

Each attack has unique identifiable attributes. Indicators of compromise are the evidence that an attack has occurred.

IOCs can be features that identify malware files, IP addresses of servers that are used in attacks, filenames, and characteristic changes made to end system software, among others.

IOCs help cybersecurity personnel identify what has happened in an attack and develop defenses against the attack.

A summary of the IOC for a piece of malware is shown in the figure.

For instance, a user receives an email claiming they have won a big prize. Clicking on the link in the email results in an attack. The IOC could include the fact the user did not enter that contest, the IP address of the sender, the email subject line, the URL to click, or an attachment to download, among others.
