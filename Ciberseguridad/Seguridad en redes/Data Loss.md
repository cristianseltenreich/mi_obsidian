Data is likely to be an organization’s most valuable asset. Organizational data can include research and development data, sales data, financial data, human resource and legal data, employee data, contractor data, and customer data.

Data loss, or data exfiltration, is when data is intentionally or unintentionally lost, stolen, or leaked to the outside world. The data loss can result in:

- Brand damage and loss of reputation
- Loss of competitive advantage
- Loss of customers
- Loss of revenue
- Litigation/legal action that results in fines and civil penalties
- Significant cost and effort to notify affected parties and recover from the breach

Network security professionals must protect the organization’s data. Various Data Loss Prevention (DLP) controls must be implemented that combine strategic, operational, and tactical measures.

Common data loss vectors are displayed below:

- Email/Social Networking
	The most common vector for data loss includes instant messaging software and social media sites. For instance, intercepted email or IM messages could be captured and reveal confidential information.
- Unencrypted Devices
	A stolen corporate laptop typically contains confidential organizational data. If the data is not stored using an encryption algorithm, then the thief can retrieve valuable confidential data.
- Cloud Storage Devices
	Saving data to the cloud has many potential benefits. 
- Removable Media
	One risk is that an employee could perform an unauthorized transfer of data to a USB drive. Another risk is that a USB drive containing valuable corporate data could be lost.
- Hard Copy
	Corporate data should be disposed of thoroughly. For example, confidential data should be shredded when no longer required. Otherwise, a thief could retrieve discarded reports and gain valuable information.
- Improper Access Control
	Passwords are the first line of defense. Stolen passwords or weak passwords which have been compromised can provide an attacker easy access to corporate data.
