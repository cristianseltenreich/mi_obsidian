**Hyperjacking**:
   - In a hyperjacking attack, an adversary exploits vulnerabilities in the hypervisor layer to gain control over the entire virtualization infrastructure.
   - Once inside the hypervisor, the attacker can manipulate VMs, access sensitive data, or disrupt services.
   - The impact of a successful hyperjacking attack can be severe, affecting all VMs hosted on the compromised hypervisor.

**Mitigation**:    
   - To prevent hyperjacking:
   - Keep hypervisor software up to date with security patches.
   - Isolate management interfaces and restrict access.
   - Monitor hypervisor logs for suspicious activity.
   - Implement network segmentation to limit lateral movement.

Remember that securing the hypervisor layer is critical for maintaining the integrity and security of virtualized environments.
