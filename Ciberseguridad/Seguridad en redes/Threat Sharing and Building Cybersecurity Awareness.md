Governments are now actively promoting cybersecurity. For instance, the US Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency (CISA) is leading efforts to automate the sharing of cybersecurity information with public and private organizations at no cost. CISA uses a system called Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS). AIS enables the sharing of attack indicators between the US government and the private sector as soon as threats are verified. CISA offers many resources that help to limit the size of the United States attack surface.

The CISA and the National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA) promote cybersecurity to all users. For example, they have an annual campaign in every October called “National Cybersecurity Awareness Month” (NCASM). This campaign was developed to promote and raise awareness about cybersecurity.

The theme for the NCASM for 2019 was “**Own IT. Secure IT. Protect IT.**” This campaign encouraged all citizens to be safer and more personally accountable for using security best practices online. The campaign provides material on a wide variety of security topics including:

- Social media safety
- Updating privacy settings
- Awareness of device app security
- Keeping software up-to-date
- Safe online shopping
- Wi-Fi safety
- Protecting customer data

The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) delivers advice and solutions for the cybersecurity challenges of the EU member states. ENISA fills a role in Europe that is similar to the role of CISA in the US.
