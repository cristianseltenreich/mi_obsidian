### Splunk Universal Forwarders

For the training, we are going to install the universal forwarder in the default configuration. Our goal is to send Windows logs to Splunk.

- Go to the Windows computer  
- Download theÂ [setup file](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/universal-forwarder.html)

- Read the Splunk General Terms - Download the MD5

  ![[Pasted image 20240227190851.png]]
  
- Open the md5 file to have the checksum: at this time is: 83a09c64537832701320609e665e3e7  
- Check your MD5 with this PowerShell command "Get-FileHash .\splunkforwarder-9.0.0.1-9e907cedecb1-x64-release.msi -Algorithm md5" to confirm you've got the right installer.

Launch the setup  
Read the Licence Agreement

Accept the Licence Agreement  
Select "an on-premises Splunk Enterprise instance" because we have to install Splunk on an on-premise server.

Once again, we use the default configuration. Maybe in your company, you will use a service account to run the Universal Forwarder.

- Give a username to Universal Forwarder.  
- Give the server IP or Hostname and the port to the receiving indexer. I use the IP because I have no DNS in my lab. We don't have to change any configuration during Splunk installation so the port used is 9997

Why do we give IP in receiving indexer and not in the deployment server? Because we don't have a Deployment server. A deployment server is a server that can send a configuration for your universal forwarder.

- Launch the install
### Check Universal Forwarder for Windows Installation

- Go to services.msc  
- Check if "SplunkForwarder Service" is up.
-

If you don't see your computer after a few minutes, try to restart the Splunk Universal Forwarder service, and check if the connection between client and server is okay.
