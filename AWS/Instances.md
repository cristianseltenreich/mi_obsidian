## Instances

An Amazon Lightsail instance is a virtual private server (also called a virtual machine).

Configure your instance with an operating system plus an application (WordPress, Drupal, Redmine, and more), or with a development stack (LAMP, Node.js, MEAN, and more). Or configure your Lightsail instance with just a base operating system (either Linux/Unix-based or Windows Server-based).

After you create instances, you can manage them here. Filter and sort the view to more efficiently track your instances, or search for a tag to view only Lightsail resources with that tag.
