The **Present Perfect** is a verb tense used to connect the past with the present. It emphasizes the result of an action rather than the time of occurrence. Here are its key features:

1. **Structure**:
    
    - **Affirmative**: Subject + (1) “have” or “has” + (2) past participle.
        - Example: “I have talked to the doctor.”
    - **Negative**: Subject + “have not” or “has not” + past participle.
        - Example: “They have not written the report.”
    - **Interrogative**: (1) “Have” or “Has” + subject + (2) past participle.
        - Example: “Have you eaten in that restaurant?”
2. **Functions**:
    
    - Expresses actions that started in the past and continue into the present.
        - Example: “I have lived in Veracruz since 1990.”
    - Indicates ongoing actions whose completion time is not specified.
        - Example: “They have gone to swim twice a week.”
    - Describes repeated actions within an indefinite time frame.
        - Example: “She has visited that museum several times.”

Mastering the Present Perfect is essential for expressing experiences and memories that still hold significance today.
