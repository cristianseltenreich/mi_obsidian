The simple future tense is a verb tense that allows us to talk about future actions. Here are the different ways of expressing the future simple:

1. **Will**: We use "will" to express probable future events, spontaneous decisions, willingness to perform an activity or to give orders. Here are some examples:
	+ **Probable future events**:
			"It will snow this weekend."
	 * **Spontaneous decisions or ideas**:
			"I will pick you up tomorrow."
	* **Willingness to do an activity**:
		"They will repair my TV tomorrow."
	* **Giving orders**:
		"You will not go to the party!".
	* **To propose or invite something**:
		"Will you marry me?".
	
	The structure of the future simple with "will" is as follows:
	* **Affirmative**: Subject + "will" + infinitive verb + complement.
	* **Negative**: Subject + "will not" (contraction: "won't") + infinitive verb + complement.
	* **Interrogative**: "Will" + subject + infinitive verb + complement.
2. **Going to**: We use "going to" to express plans that are 100% certain to happen or predictions of which we are certain. Some examples:
	* Sure plans:
		"I am going to present my final exams tomorrow.".
		"They are going to eat out tonight." 
	* Safe predictions:
		"Your concert is going to be the best of the year!".
		"I am not going to study law in that university".
	The structure of the future simple with "going to" is:
	* Subject + present tense of the auxiliary verb "be" + "going to" + infinitive of the main verb.
