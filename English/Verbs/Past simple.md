The past simple is a verb tense in English used to express actions or situations that occurred and ended in the past. It is formed with the verb in its past form, which for regular verbs ends in -ed, and for irregular verbs has a special form. For example:

I lived in London for two years.
She studied hard for the exam. 
He played soccer yesterday.
They went to the park.
She saw a movie with her friends.
He knew the answer.
We gave him a present. 
She wrote a letter. 
He broke his arm. 
They chose the blue one.

The simple past has a definitive character, unlike the continuous past, which has a durative character.
